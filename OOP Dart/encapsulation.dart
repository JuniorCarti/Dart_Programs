//encapsulation.dart
// Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming 
//that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods.
// It allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified, promoting data hiding and abstraction.
// In Dart, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like `private` and `public`.
//using encapsulation, you can protect the internal state of an object and expose 
//only what is necessary through public methods.
//private members are accessible only within the class, 
//while public members can be accessed from outside the class.
//In Dart, prefix a variable or method with an underscore _ to make it private to its library.
