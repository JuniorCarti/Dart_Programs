//encapsulation.dart
// Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming 
//that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods.
// It allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified, promoting data hiding and abstraction.
// In Dart, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like `private` and `public`.
