//constrcutors.dart
//Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they're created.
//Defined using the class name and can have parameters to set initial values for the object's properties.
//Default constructor: If no constructor is defined, Dart provides a default one that initializes all properties to 
//their default values (null for objects, 0 for numbers, false for booleans).
