//types of polymorphism in dart
// There are two main types of polymorphism in Dart:
// 1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)
// 2. Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)
// Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, 
//where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters.
// Runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding,
//where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
// In Dart, polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overriding.
