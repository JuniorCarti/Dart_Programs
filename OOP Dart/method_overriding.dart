//method overriding in Dart
// Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method 
//that is already defined in its superclass.
//A child class can override a parent's method to provide a different implementation.
// Key terms
// - Method Overriding: Redefining a method in a subclass that already exists in the parent class.
// - @override: An annotation used to indicate that a method is being overridden.
// - super: Used to call the parent class's method from the child class.
