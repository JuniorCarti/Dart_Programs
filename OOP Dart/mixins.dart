//mixins in dart
// Mixins are a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies.
// They allow you to add functionality to classes without using inheritance.
// Mixins are defined using the `mixin` keyword and can be applied to classes using the `with` keyword.
//mixins allow a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple classes without using traditional inheritance
//inheritance is a one-to-one relationship, while mixins allow for a one-to-many relationship
