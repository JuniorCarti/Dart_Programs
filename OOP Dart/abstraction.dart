//Abstraction means showing only the necessary details and hiding the internal complexity.
//It helps in reducing complexity and improving code maintainability.
// In Dart, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
//example is driving a car
//You only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gears (abstraction).
//You donâ€™t need to know how the engine, transmission, or ECU works (hidden implementation).
