//classes and objects
//understanding classes and objects in dart
// a class is a blueprint for creating objects
// an object is an instance of a class
// a class can have properties and methods
//A class is a blueprint for creating objects. 
//It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
//An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity based on the class blueprint.
//Real-world analogy: Think of a class as a blueprint for a house. 
//The blueprint defines the structure (number of rooms, floors, etc.), but it's not a house itself. 
//The object is the actual house built from that blueprint.
