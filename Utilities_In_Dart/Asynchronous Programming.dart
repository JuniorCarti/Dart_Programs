//Asynchronous programming allows your code to perform tasks 
//without waiting for other tasks to complete. It's like saying:
//Do this task, and while you’re at it, I’ll go do something else and come back when you’re done.”
//This is especially useful for tasks that take time to complete, like:
//Fetching data from the internet
//Reading/writing files
//Waiting for user input
//Making API requests

//Synchronous Code:
//Code is executed line by line.
//Each task waits for the previous one to finish.
void main() {
  print("Start");
  print("Processing...");
  print("End");
}
