//polymorphism.dart
// This code snippet demonstrates polymorphism in Dart.
// Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
//// In this example, we will create a base class `Shape` and
/// two derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
/// // The derived classes will override a method to calculate the area of the shape.
/// // The base class will define a method that can be overridden by the derived classes.
/// // The derived classes will implement their own version of the method.
/// // This allows us to call the same method on different objects and get different results.
/// // The base class
