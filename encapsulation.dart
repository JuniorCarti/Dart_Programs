//encapsulation.dart
// This file demonstrates encapsulation in Dart.
// Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming 
//that restricts direct access to an object's data and methods.
// It allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified,
// promoting data integrity and security.
// In Dart, encapsulation is achieved using classes and access modifiers.
// The following code snippet illustrates encapsulation by defining 
//a class with private fields and public methods.
