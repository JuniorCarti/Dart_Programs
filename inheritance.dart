//inheritance.dart
// This code snippet demonstrates inheritance in Dart.
// Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class,
// promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.
// In this example, we will create a base class `Vehicle` and two derived classes `Car` and `Bike`.
