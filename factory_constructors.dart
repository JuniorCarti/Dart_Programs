//factory constructors.dart
// This code snippet demonstrates the use of factory constructors in Dart.
// Factory constructors are a special type of constructor that can return an instance of a class or a subclass.
// They are useful when you want to control the instantiation process, such as 
//returning a cached instance or creating an instance of a subclass based on some condition.
